## Key Functionalities

### Accessibility Report Generation
Utilizing BeautifulSoup for website scraping, WebAlly analyzes the site's HTML and CSS content for accessibility barriers. It employs GPT-4 AI to interpret and evaluate the site's elements, pinpointing specific areas that could hinder accessibility for users with disabilities.

### ARIA Compliance Scoring
WebAlly computes an WW3C ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) compliance score ranging from 0 to 10. This score is a quantitative measure of the website's alignment with the W3C's ARIA accessibility standards, providing a clear assessment of its current accessibility status.

### Recommendations for Improvement
Beyond identifying issues, WebAlly provides actionable recommendations to enhance web accessibility. These suggestions are tailored to improve navigational ease, readability, and overall compliance with web accessibility guidelines.

### Updated Code Generation
WebAlly's most notable feature is its ability to generate updated code that implements its recommendations. This feature allows developers to seamlessly implement necessary changes, ensuring their websites are not only ARIA-compliant but also more inclusive for users with disabilities. 

## TruLens Integration
WebAlly integrates TruLens' text-to-text application for logging and feedback purposes. This integration allows us to continuously improve our LLM-based application by analyzing the feedback and refining our algorithms.
